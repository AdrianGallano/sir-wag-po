# Folder Structure

### _only a opinion and reseach_

- Context folder: for global state. kinda hard to explain but its to avoid props drilling (passing data thru multiple components even tho it doesnt need the data).
- Component Folder: contains the building block of a page. -- example: buttons | filters | lists | form.
- Page folder: contains the pages in which the components are compiled.
- Models folder: contains mostly data models or interfaces that defines the shape and structure of the data that will be used within the application.
- Service folder: d ko alam yan hahhahha.
